# Botanica: Contemporary Art Outside PWA

> Discover a stunning open-air art exhibition in the heart of Brisbane City at Botanica - Contemporary Art Outside from 7-16 May 2021, in the City Botanic Gardens from 5-10pm daily.

This repo is based on the [Amsterdam Light Festival PWA](https://github.com/AshKyd/amsterdam-light-festival-mobile) from 2019. I built it because accessing Google Maps embeds SUUUUCKS on mobile.

It's a messy little project built on Mapbox GL, but I like it.
